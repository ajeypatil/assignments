# Objective

*The Objective of this project is to analyze Flight Delay and Cancellations  for US Airlines and determine best airline for least flight delays and cancellations.*

# Overview

When multiple airlines are available in metro area, then residents have choice of airline. An analysis of airlines performance   in terms of flight delay and cancellation is required for passengers to choose an airline with least cancelations and delays.

Decision Prediction
The predictions of best airline of choice in US would be made based on how big the airline is in terms
of number of flights and relative delays and cancellations per flight.


# Data Sources

The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. Summary information on the number of on-time, delayed, canceled, and diverted flights is published in DOT's monthly Air Travel Consumer Report and in this dataset of 2015 flight delays and cancellations. https://www.kaggle.com/usdot/flight-delays/data

# Key Roles
## Model Creation
1. Model Creator : Ajey Patil

## Model Experts
1. The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics

## Model Users
1. Airline Passengers: this analysis will help them choose airline    depending on airport performance of flight delays and cancellations 
2. Airport management: this report will help them determine systemic and process  related issues affecting flight delays and cancellations 
3. Airline management: this report will help them determine best performing  airports in terms of flight delays and canceellations and their reasons  in scheduling and flight route planning.
4. Regulatory boards: this analysis will assist in identifying consistenly  low performing airlines in terms of flight cancellations and delays and   their reasons 

# Current State and Reasons for Project Consideration:
This project was considered for analysis due to increasing number of complaints from airline passengers
about the delays and cancellations of certain airlines and make predictions available to passengers of
an airline based on past performance.


# Deliverables
The deliverables for this project will include a report of all the findings, r code, all of which will be published on GitHub.

Specific analysis to be done and questions to be explored

    Chart of all airlines and number of flights cancelled per day of week.

    Chart of all airlines and number of flights delayes per day of week.

    Chart of average delay time and all airlines and day of week.

    Chart of Category the delay reason for flights for airline and numbers of delays per delay reason

    Based on number of delays per delay reason and number of delays per day of week, 
    predict best airline for minimum flight delay and cancellations.


# Success Criteria

Success criteria of project:

Benefits of the Project:
Airline Passengers will be able to choose best airline and
Airline Management will be made aware of quality of their service

Project Success Metric:
When the analysis is done year-or-year, the improvement in average delays and cancellations
per airline is measurable and is expected to reduce 10% year-over-year

Model Analysis Success Metric:
The model analysis and prediction should predict airline delays and cancellations
with accuracy greater than 95% and ROC greater than 0.75

# Risks

1. Availability of data in required format for different years of observations of data

2. Project Risks: Airlines cannot improve improve delays and cancellations year-over-year

3. Prediction Risks: Model Analysis and Prediction cannot predict with accuracy greater than 95% and 
  ROC greater than 0.75 then more data is needed
  
# Deployment Phases

Initial Analysis Phase: R-code for preliminary analysis of data

Initial Prediction Phase: R-code for preliminary prediction of deliverables

Final Model Deployment Phase: R-code to generate reports for yearly data

Deployment to Airline Passengers Impact:
This model would be deployed to all airline passengers as yearly report
and they can make choice of airline for up-coming year based on report.

Risks of Deployment:
The deployment of model as yearly report may be rejected by airline
and hence analysis performed must be made public to airlines which
can then verify the scientific analysis of the data.

# Timeline of Project

1. Data Availablity: Yearly data made available The U.S. Department of 
Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transport Statistics

2. Prediction Report Availability : One month after yearly data is made available

3. Effort Required for Predictions : One man-month

# Costs

To be estimated
