Template
 - [ ] Created an rstudio template for the *FPS*
 
FPS Should:

 - Introduction: 
   - [x] State the business problem in the title/first sentence or paragraph.
   - [ ] Identified one or more specific decision(s) that will be helped. 
   
 - [-] Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - [ ] Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - [ ] Identified "current"" state.

 - Define project's success
   - [x] State what the analysis would do
   - [ ] Estimate benefits of the project 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) a success metric for the project: a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution in order to be successful.
   - [ ] Identify any non-quantifiable benefits 
     
 - Define model/analysis success 
   - [ ] Define/quantify (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success.

 - Estimate Risks
   - [ ] What if the success metric is not met?
   - [ ] What if the model performance metric is not met?

 - Deployment
   - [x] Identify **who** the users of the model/analysis are 
   - [x] Identify **how** the model/analysis will used 
   - [ ] Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - [ ] Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )

 - [ ] Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - [ ] **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - [ ] **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance will be sufficient to solve the problem  
   - [ ] How much effort it will take to deploy the solutions.

 - [x] Is free of grammar/spelling/punctuation mistakes
 

## NOTES

 - In general this *FPS* is in need of a lot of work in what is communicating to 
   the business user.  It is almost devoid of specific details that are relevant
   and will ensure that a project with this *FPS* is a failure. Please continue
   to revise this according to the above rubic as you work on your final project.
   IF these are not fixed for your final project you are in jeopardy of not 
   passing this course.
 
 - You need to specify *measureable* success criteria related to your project.
 
 - This project is rather a basic analysis and seemingly lacks any advances 
   analytical component. You should think about how to expand this. For example, 
   a) for a given route and travel time.
   b) based on airfare, etc.
   
 - Your success criteria is meaningless boilerplate.
   
 - There is a disconnect between your objective and stakeholders.  It is not 
   clear how the stakeholders benefit.    
   
 - You confuse stakeholders with users. They are not necessarily the same and 
   arguably not in this case.
   
 - The stated objective does not 
 
 - "co-relation" is not meaningful. Do you mean "coorelation"?
   
 - A deliverable is not: 
    
    What is co-relation between airline and day of week of flight that got cancelled ?
    
   That is a question. You need to specify a chart, a number, a tool that shows, ...
   
 - Where is your template?
